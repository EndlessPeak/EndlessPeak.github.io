## 基本情况

### 自我介绍

Tell me a few things about yourself.

Dear professors, it's a great honor for me to have the opportunity to present myself. My name is Li Qing han,22 years old, come from Hu Bei province.  I have received my bachelor's degree in software engineering from Chang 'an University.  It has always been my dream to further my education at your renowned university, so I'll try my best to strive for this hard-won chance.

In the past 4 years,I focused on my study. I have passed CET-4 and CET-6 in my sophomore and junior years respectively and got a good ranking in software engineering subjects,about 3.4,not the GPA by the way. In the need of my major,I participated in the course design and internship based on group cooperation for seven times and served as the deputy leader in three of them. These course design and internships are most implemented by Java,like Java Server Page or Mybatis and Spring,of course sometimes we use C++ for development,but that's rarely. The technologies we use are constantly developing while our technical level is progressively improving. In addition, the experience of participating in these cooperation enhanced my ability of overall division of labor and interpersonal communication.

In my mind,my strongest asset is my ability to focused on things until they all get done,never give up easily. When I meet a hard nut to crack, a great sense of responsibility pushed me to forge ahead; while the job over,an incomparable sense of accomplishment combined with fulfillment fountained in my heart. As the saying goes,every coin has two sides and I am no exception. The strive for high quality sometimes leads to an defective ends in efficiency. In addition,being focused on work inevitably leads to certain social drawbacks and less time to deal with life matters, that might be my greatest weakness I think.

I think my English level is fair,I make such assessment based on my experience. I installed Arch Linux on my computer hard drive independently followed by the instructions from *Arch Linux Installation Guide*. I also read the least square support vector machine and its weighted version of the paper to broaden my mind in the process of my graduation project.

My graduation project is the concrete realization of three traditional machine learning algorithms, including decision tree, support vector machine and feed forward neural network. The more I learn,the more I know I am ignorance, the more I find postgraduate is necessary. I dreamed one day I can have the chance to make a little contribution in computer science and technology,and the way is now in front of me. That’s all my self introduction,thank you.

### 针对提问

1. You mentioned Java Web, please tell me Java Server Page, Mybatis and Springboot concepts and what are they used for.

   Sure. JSP stands for Java Server Page, it is a dynamic web page technology standard developed by Sun Company. JSP can deal with complex business requirements together with other Java programs on the server. It use JDBC (java database connectivity) to access the database.

   Mybatis is an excellent persistence layer framework that supports customized SQL, stored procedures, and advanced mapping. It avoids almost all of the JDBC code and manual setting of parameters. It makes create,read,update and delete more easier.

   The Spring framework is an open source container framework that integrates various types of tools and frameworks and provides comprehensive functionality, services, and management.

2. What is the installation process for Arch Linux?

   The principle is simple, but the process is a bit complicated, mainly because there are so many settings involved. The installation process of Arch Linux **boils down** to two steps: preparation and installation. Preparation includes prepare the installation media, check the Live environment, check the boot mode and network connection, select mirror service, and mount disks. Installation includes downloading the basic system packages, change root, and configure the system.

3. Could you describe the least squre support vector machine and its weighted version briefly?

   The least square support vector machine follows structural risk minimization and can simplify calculation. Its weighted version addresses the issue of sensitivity to **outliers** and reduces the error.

4. Can you give an example of your perseverance in your work?

   

## 报考学校及专业

1. Why do you want to go to graduate school instead of finding a job?

   During my undergraduate studies in the past four years,I gradually realized that the knowledge of science and technology are no limit. Therefore, my thirst for knowledge should never cease but grow as I dig deeper into this field. On the other hand,the knowledge and skills I acquired in college would probably be not enough for me to fulfill my personal goals in society. So I think it's necessary for me to further my study instead of going to work after graduation.

2. Why do you choose computer science and technology instead of software engineering as your major?

   I made this choice based on my own understanding. In my undergraduate studies, I thought software engineering as a program development paradigm,while computer science and technology is a broad and profound science. Since I have learned how to learn a skill, now is the time for me to learn how to learn a science. I wish I could achieve systematic knowledge acquisition in this way.

3. Why do you choose to study at our school / institute? 

   I was initially attracted by your university's high reputation. I have a classmate who have studied at your university,after consulting with him,I was even more impressed by the university's strong academic atmosphere and the professors' sense of responsibility. All of which strengthened my determination to try my best to start my studies at here.

4. What's your impression of UESTC?

   University of Electronic Science and Technology of China is one of the key university. It is the forefront of modern socialist universities both at home and abroad in the coordinated development of science and technology. I was initially attracted by your university's high reputation. I have a classmate who have studied at your university,he told me that I will be impressed by university's strong academic atmosphere and professors' sense of responsibility, I'm convinced of that with no doubt.

5. Which kind of professors do you like best?

   Every professor has his own teaching style and methods. As for me, I can adjust my own situation to adapt to the professors. Maybe those who are knowledgeable and own the sense of responsibility and have strong scientific research and innovation ability would be my favorite.

6. How do the people around you think of computer science and technology/software engineering?

   

7. What do you think have been the most important change in your study field over the past 5 years?

   

## 个人问题

1. What's your greatest advantage and what's the worst weakness?

   My greatest asset I think is my ability to focused on things until they all get done. When I meet a hard nut to crack, a great sense of responsibility pushed me to forge ahead; while the job over,an incomparable sense of accomplishment combined with fulfillment fountained in my heart.

   But when I am busy programming,my time has been spent on focusing on unsolved problems in developing without dealing with personal life matters. That's my worst weakness. 

   Of course sometimes I will suspend some difficult problems for advancing the overall development of the software. Taking unnecessary pains to study these problems that may be beyond my personal competence may won't have the desired results. Write them down and discuss them with others will be a better choice.

2. Have you attended any training institutions or similar programs before?

   I once consulted the postgraduate entrance examination training agency for knowing some information about the postgraduate entrance examination there, and compare it with the information I collected by myself. I think it is not cost-effective and unreasonable to spend money on postgraduate training. The purpose of the postgraduate examination is to cultivate our ability of self-learning,information inquiring,interpersonal communication, and most importantly,believing in ourselves.

## 未来规划

1. What do you expect to achieve during your study if you are enrolled into this institute? 

   OR: What is your plan in the postgraduate study?

   If I have the honor to get the chance to learn at here,I will concentrate on the study and research in the selected field. First,I will work hard to learn the theoretical knowledge, constructing a solid foundation for my further study. Second,I would like to strengthen my language ability, for example,learn C & C plus plus and python in the hard way,especially the STL. Third, I plan to do some practical work with the help of my supervisor. Through this,I can get skills which cannot be acquired from the textbooks or corporation. I hope that in the next three years, I can improve my capacity of self-learning and independent thinking, and have valuable academic outputs. 

2. If you failed this time what will you do in the near future?

   Failure doesn't matter. I would conclude the weakness I had during the period and summary what I have learned. Maybe I will apply for other college or choose to find a job. Whatever I choose, I will never stop striving to do my best.

3. What are your future goals? Will you continue studying or find a job?

   Learning is to master a certain ability that they can contribute to the state, society, family and live a more comfortable life, if I can find a suitable job when I graduate and  meet the requirements, I will choose to make contribution in practical application. Else,continuing to study will be better for me.

4. What is your plan for the next 5 years?

## 本科学习

1. Please introduce your university.
   
   I studied in Chang 'an University as an undergraduate, which is located in Xi 'an, the ancient capital of six dynasties. The campus is a rectangle, the library is the tallest building on campus,seats in the center of the rectangle. It has a variety of books,whichever book I need, I can always find it in the library. The northeast of the library is the dormitory, while the northwest is the car test ground, the southwest is the teaching building, and the southeast is the laboratory.  I really appreciate the scenery of my campus. There are two artificial lakes in the school, and the teaching building is built against the lakes. Studying in such an environment will feel relaxed and happy.
   
2. Tell me something about your graduation thesis.

3. Which course do you like best?

   My favorite course is data structure,because the teacher's class was very interesting, which stimulated my interest in programming,and helped me learn a lot of practical vocational skills. In addition,the data structure is important in future professional development. Therefore, I studied really hard in this course.

4. What impressed you most during your college years?

5. Tell me something about your major.

6. Please tell me about your study details in your college.

7. What qualifications have you obtained? 证书

8. What have you learned from your internship experience? 实习

9. What have you learned from your research experience/competition experience?

   科研经历或竞赛经历
   
   Sorry but  I did not participate in any scientific research or competition activities during my undergraduate study actually. I tried ACM team selection when I was a freshman, but I didn't pay enough attention to it and didn't prepare enough at that time, so I failed. I hope I can obtain more abundant scientific research experience in the postgraduate stage.

## 其他问题（待完善）

介绍家乡

介绍下C与Java的区别

## 专业问题

1. What's the difference of C and Java?

2. Please state your understanding of Object-oriented programming.

   面向对象编程：抽象、继承、封装、多态

3. Please talk about TCP/IP. 

   TCP/IP is a protocol cluster that can transfer information between different networks. It contains FTP、SMTP、TCP、UDP、IP and other protocols. It is divided into application layer, transmission layer, Internet layer and network interface layer. The main protocols of the application layer are HTTP,FTP,DNS. Transmission layer have UDP and TCP protocols. Internet layer use IP,ICMP,IGMP protocols,network interface layer applys ARP protocol for communication.

4. What's the difference between TCP and UDP, and what's the full name of UDP?

   TCP is a  connection-oriented protocol while UDP is a connectionless protocol. A TCP connection can be established only after packet exchanges for three times and disconnect before four additional packet exchanges.  UDP transmits information without establish conncetion. TCP is reliable but UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery. TCP uses stream mode and UDP uses datagram mode. TCP guarantees data order, UDP does not.

   The full name of TCP/UDP is Transmission Control Protocol/User data Protocol.

With the deepening understanding of machine learning, I have developed a strong interest in this field. They will gradually play an increasingly important role with the development of science and technology, I hope one day I have the chance to make a contribution in it. 



Life is precious, it is necessary to catch any opportunity for self-development, especially in the competitive modern society.
