  <h2 id="基本情况">基本情况</h2>
<h3 id="自我介绍">自我介绍</h3>
<p>Tell me a few things about yourself.</p>
<p>Dear professors, it&rsquo;s a great honor for me to have the opportunity to present myself. My name is Li Qing han,22 years old, come from Hu Bei province.  I received my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in software engineering from Chang&rsquo;an University in last June.</p>
<p>In the past 4 years,I focused on my study. I passed CET-4 and CET-6 in my sophomore and junior years respectively and got good grades in some software engineering subjects. In the need of my major,I participated in the course design and internship based on group cooperation as much as possible and served as the deputy leader in three of them. These development activities are most belongs to Java Web,such as Java Server Page, Java Bean,Mybatis and Spring. The technologies we use are constantly developing while our technical level is progressively improving. In addition, the experience of participating in these cooperation enhanced my ability of overall division of labor and interpersonal communication.</p>
<p>In my mind,I think my English comprehensive ability meet the postgraduate&rsquo;s requirement. For example, I installed Arch Linux on my computer hard drive independently followed by the instruction manuals written in English. In the process of my graduation project,I tried to read the English paper such as <strong>least square version</strong> support vector machine,for which I read to broaden my view.</p>
<p>My graduation project is the concrete realization of three traditional machine learning algorithms, including decision tree, support vector machine and feed forward neural network. The more I learn,the more I find postgraduate is necessary. I dreamed one day I can have the chance to make a little contribution in academic research.</p>
<p>That’s all my self introduction,thank you.</p>
<h3 id="针对提问">针对提问</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Please introduce your internship or course design.</p>
<p>The content of the  internship I participated in is to build an online furniture mall. Unlike Taobao, jd.com and other online shopping malls, my practice project simplifies the role,which means the seller and the system administrator is the same role and own the whole system. Buyers can register, log in, browse goods, add goods to the shopping cart, settle and generate orders; The system administrator can manage orders, deliver goods for orders, and manage the user information of each buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mentioned Java Web, please tell me Java Server Page, Mybatis and Springboot concepts and what are they used for.</p>
<p>Sure. JSP stands for Java Server Page, it is a dynamic web page technology standard developed by Sun Company. JSP can deal with problems together with other Java programs on the server. It use JDBC (java database connectivity) to access the database.</p>
<p>Mybatis is a persistence layer framework that supports customized SQL and advanced mapping.It makes create,read,update and delete more easier.</p>
<p>The Spring framework is an open source container framework that integrates various types of tools and frameworks and provides comprehensive functionality, services, and management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the installation process for Arch Linux?</p>
<p>The installation process of Arch Linux <strong>boils down</strong> to two steps: preparation and installation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Preparation includes prepare the installation media, check the Live environment, check the boot mode and network connection, select mirror service, and mount disks.</li>
<li>Installation includes downloading the basic system packages, change root, and configure the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>What&rsquo;s your understanding about machine learning?
Machine learning is a multidisciplinary discipline, <u>involving probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, algorithm and complexity theory,linear algebra and other disciplines.</u></p>
<p>Machine learning using experience to improve performance.</p>
<p>It specializes in the study of how computers simulate or realize human learning behavior to acquire new knowledge or skills and reorganize the existing knowledge structure to continuously improve its own performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could you describe the machine learning algorithms used in your graduation project briefly?</p>
<p>Sure. My graduation project is to solve the classification problem, using decision tree, support vector machine and feed forward neural network.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decision tree select optimal attribute by <strong>information gain ratio</strong> to divide in every decision and obtain the final result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support Vector Machine <strong>partition a classified hyperplane in high dimensional space.</strong> It can also be considered to be developed from the idea of structural risk minimization, in which its loss function is the hinge loss function.</p>
<p>The least square support vector machine takes all samples as support vectors and transforms inequality constraints into equality constraints to simplify calculation of <strong>Lagrange multipliers.</strong></p>
<p>Its weighted version <u>addresses the issue of sensitivity to <strong>outliers</strong> and reduces the error.</u></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feed forward neural network corrects the weight of each layer by calculating the error between the output value and the actual value.</p>

<p>Why do you want to go to graduate school instead of finding a job?</p>
<p>Life is precious, it is necessary to catch any opportunity for self-development, especially in the competitive modern society. I think further my education will be a good choice for self-development.</p>
<p>The knowledge of science and technology are no limit. Therefore, my thirst for knowledge should never cease but grow as I dig deeper into this field.</p>
<p>Computer science and technology is a broad and profound science, <u>in which I hope to improve my cognitive ability, self-learning ability, independent thinking ability and critical thinking ability</u>, broaden my vision and scope, and learn more knowledge.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s necessary for me to further my study instead of going to work after graduation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you choose computer science and technology instead of software engineering as your major?</p>
<p>I thought software engineering as a program development paradigm,while computer science and technology is a broad and profound science.</p>
<p>Since I have learned how to learn a skill, now is the time for me to learn how to learn a science. I wish I could achieve systematic knowledge acquisition in this way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you choose to study at our school / institute?</p>
<p><u>It has always been my dream to further my education at your renowned university.</u></p>
<p>I was initially attracted by your university&rsquo;s high reputation. I have a classmate who have studied at your university,after consulting with him,I was even more impressed by the university&rsquo;s strong academic atmosphere and the professors&rsquo; sense of responsibility. All of which strengthened my determination to try my best to start my studies at here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s your impression of UESTC?</p>
<p>Formerly known as Chengdu Institute of Telecommunications Engineering formed in 1956,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China is one of the key university. It is the forefront of modern socialist universities both at home and abroad in the coordinated development of science and technology.</p>
<p>With electronic information science and technology as the core and engineering as the major, the university is a multi-disciplinary and research-oriented national key university.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="计划与打算">计划与打算</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you have any plans to study abroad?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read about it before. Studying abroad has certain requirements on academic performance and professional quality. If there is a chance, I will have a try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you feel about choosing a <strong>mentor</strong>?Which kind of <strong>professors</strong> do you like best?</p>
<p>I have known about various research teams in advance, and I am very interested in these unknown fields. However, I don&rsquo;t have any special ideas in choosing a <strong>tutor</strong>. Each professors has his or her own unique academic methods and characteristics. What I should do is to improve myself as much as possible and try to get the right tutor to choose me,adjust my own situation to adapt to him.</p>
<p><em>Maybe those who are knowledgeable and own the sense of responsibility and have strong scientific research and innovation ability would be my favorite.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you considering reading a PhD?</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if I can meet my ability and have the opportunity to study for a PhD. I hope that through three years of study and accumulation as a postgraduate, I can master various abilities required by academic research, study in the field I am interested in, and go further and longer on the academic road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do the people around you think of computer science and technology/software engineering?</p>
<p>They usually can&rsquo;t distinguish the difference between computer science and technology and software engineering, but they all think that computer major has a good combination in many positions in today&rsquo;s society, and people engaged in computer work are usually regarded as high-quality compound talents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="个人问题">个人问题</h2>

<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s your greatest advantage and what&rsquo;s the worst weakness?</p>
<p>My strongest asset I think is my ability to focused on things until they all get done,never give up easily. When I meet a hard nut to crack, a great sense of responsibility pushed me to forge ahead; while the job is over,an incomparable sense of accomplishment combined with fulfillment fountained in my heart.</p>
<p>The strive for high quality sometimes leads to an defective ends in efficiency. In addition,being focused on work inevitably leads to certain social drawbacks and less time to deal with life matters, that might be my greatest weakness I think.</p>
<p>Of course sometimes I will suspend some difficult problems for advancing the overall development of the software. Write them down and discuss them with others will be a good choice.</p>
<p><em>Taking unnecessary pains to study these problems that may be beyond my personal competence may won&rsquo;t have the desired results.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you attended any training institutions or similar programs before?</p>
<p>I once consulted the postgraduate entrance examination training agency for knowing some information about the postgraduate entrance examination there, and compare it with the information I collected by myself.</p>
<p>I think it is not cost-effective and unreasonable to spend money on postgraduate training. The purpose of the postgraduate examination is to <strong>cultivate</strong> our ability of self-learning,information inquiring,interpersonal communication, and most importantly,believing in ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you failed this time what will you do in the near future?</p>
<p>Failure doesn&rsquo;t matter. I would conclude the weakness I had during the period and summary what I have learned. Maybe I will apply for other college or choose to find a job. Whatever I choose, I will never stop striving to do my best.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you expect to achieve during your study if you are enrolled into this institute?</p>
<p>OR: What is your plan in the postgraduate study?</p>
<p>If I have the honor to get the chance to learn at here,I will concentrate on the study and research in the selected field. First,I will work hard to learn the theoretical knowledge, constructing a solid foundation for my further study. Second,I would like to strengthen my language ability, for example,learn C &amp; C plus plus and python in the hard way,especially the STL. Third, I plan to do some practical work with the help of my supervisor. Through this,I can get skills which cannot be acquired from the textbooks or corporation. I hope that in the next three years, I can improve my capacity of self-learning and independent thinking, and have valuable academic outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are your future goals? Will you continue studying or find a job?</p>
<p>Learning is to master a certain ability that they can contribute to the state, society, family and live a more comfortable life, if I can find a suitable job when I graduate and  meet the requirements, I will choose to make contribution in practical application. Else,continuing to study will be better for me.</p>

<li>
<p>Please introduce your university.</p>
<p>I studied in Chang &lsquo;an University as an undergraduate, which is located in Xi &lsquo;an, the ancient capital of the six dynasties.</p>
<p>The campus is rectangular, which means &ldquo;grew up in Chang &lsquo;an University&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The library, called Shaw Building, is the tallest building on campus and is located in the rectangular center.</p>
<p>The northeast of the library is the dormitory, while the northwest is the car test ground, the southwest is the teaching building, and to the southeast is the laboratory.</p>
<p>The school extends along weishui, and the teaching building is built according to the lake. I appreciate the scenery of the campus very much. Learning in such an environment make me feel relaxed and happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell me something about your graduation thesis. (See Self Introduction Related Questions)</p>
<p>Sure. My graduation project is to solve the classification problem, using decision tree, support vector machine and feed forward neural network.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decision tree select optimal attribute to divide in every decision and obtain the final result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support Vector Machine <u>partition a classified hyperplane in high dimensional space.</u></p>
<p>The least square support vector machine <u>follows structural risk minimization</u> and can simplify calculation.</p>
<p>Its weighted version <u>addresses the issue of sensitivity to <strong>outliers</strong> and reduces the error.</u></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feed forward neural network corrects the weight of each layer by calculating the error between the output value and the actual value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which course do you like best?</p>
<p>My favorite course is data structure,because the teacher&rsquo;s class was very interesting, which stimulated my interest in programming,and helped me learn a lot of practical vocational skills. In addition,the data structure is important in future professional development. Therefore, I studied really hard in this course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What impressed you most during your college years?</p>
<p>It was one day when I was still working on my undergraduate graduation project,I was a new bud of Python at that time. The prototype had already been realized , but when it comes to the specific data set, the compiler always reported errors. In order to solve the problem,I worked on it from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. without eating or drinking. I was very hungry and it was raining hard outside, but the anger and dissatisfaction in the deep side of my heart push me forge ahead. Until I solved lots of basic mistakes, and watched it from reading data step by step to finally getting the final results, an incomparable satisfaction and accomplishment fountained in my heart. I guess that moment impressed me most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell me something about your major.</p>
<p>My undergraduate major is software engineering. I think my major provides a flexible but standardized software development paradigm. Through the combination of scientific demand analysis, outline design and detailed design, the needs of customers and the realization of software can be more standard and scientific, and the scalability and maintainability of software will also be improved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please tell me about your study details in your college.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualifications have you obtained? 证书</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What have you learned from your internship experience? 实习</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What have you learned from your research experience/competition experience?</p>
<p>Sorry but I did not participate in any scientific research or competition activities during my undergraduate study actually. I tried ACM team selection when I was a freshman, but I didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to it and didn&rsquo;t prepare enough at that time, so I failed. I hope I can obtain more abundant scientific research experience in the postgraduate stage.</p>

<p>Tell me something about your family.</p>
<p>There are three members in my family,my parents and me. Generally speaking,My family is warm and harmonious.</p>
<p>My father is a <strong>intermediate</strong> engineer in the elevator industry. He&rsquo;s been helping me with my study for as long as I can remember. He usually told me attitude decides achievement. Every sunny weekend he will go fishing. According to him, fishing can not only train patience but make people feel ease and comfortable.</p>
<p>My mother is a factory product inspector. No matter in work or life, she is always meticulous. Caution is the only way to avoid making mistakes. Under her influence, I always double-check my important work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell me something about your hometown.</p>
<p>My hometown is Suizhou, located in the north of Hubei Province. The world-famous chime bells were unearthed here. It is also the birthplace of Yan Emperor Shen Nong, the ancestor of The Chinese empire. What&rsquo;s more, Suizhou is rich in producing special propose vehicles. It is called special propose vehicles&rsquo; mother land.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the difference of C and Java?</p>
<p>C is <strong>procedural</strong> oriented, while Java is object oriented. C is a compiled language, and Java is a kind of hybrid language of compilation and interpretation. In addition, the application of C and Java are different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please state your understanding of Object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming is mainly composed of four concepts: abstraction, <strong>inheritance</strong>, <strong>encapsulation</strong> and <strong>polymorphism</strong>.</p>
<p>Models are meant to characterize things in the real world. Abstract is a way to describe the specific characteristics of things and the law of change.</p>
<p>Inheritance make it possible to share methods and member variables between parent and child classes.</p>
<p>Encapsulate the function to reuse code and perform specific functions.</p>
<p>Polymorphism refers to the fact that methods of the same name in a parent class can have different implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please talk about TCP/IP.</p>
<p>TCP/IP is a protocol cluster that can transfer information between different networks. It contains FTP、SMTP、TCP、UDP、IP and other protocols. It is divided into application layer, transmission layer, Internet layer and network interface layer. The main protocols of the application layer are HTTP,FTP,DNS. Transmission layer have UDP and TCP protocols. Internet layer use IP,ICMP,IGMP protocols,network interface layer applys ARP protocol for communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between TCP and UDP, and what&rsquo;s the full name of UDP?</p>
<p>TCP is a  connection-oriented protocol while UDP is a connectionless protocol. A TCP connection can be established only after packet exchanges for three times and disconnect before four additional packet exchanges.  UDP transmits information without establish conncetion. TCP is reliable but UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery. TCP uses stream mode and UDP uses datagram mode. TCP guarantees data order, UDP does not.</p>
<p>The full name of TCP/UDP is Transmission Control Protocol/User data Protocol.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the deepening understanding of machine learning, I have developed a strong interest in this field. They will gradually play an increasingly important role with the development of science and technology, I hope one day I have the chance to make a contribution in it.</p>
